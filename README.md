# BubbleSort_assignment
assignment in Java class

We had to do some test on BubbleSort to calculate constant k and relationship of algorithm (quadratic). 
I decided to include the values I tested (it runs a series of ten values and then calculates the average)
and also map it out in a graph. Not all values are accurate, so there is not a smooth quadratic curve
and I could have mapped more values, but you can still see the quadratic relationship.
